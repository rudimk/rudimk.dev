# Hello. I'm Rudraksh, but you can call me Rudi.

I'm primarily an infrastructure and data engineering specialist. I help companies architect their infrastructure and data engineering stacks for maximum performance, resilience and flexibility. Containers? Infrastructure-as-Code? Cloud architecture? Tensorflow ipelines? Cloud cost optimisation? I'm your guy.

Right now, i'm the Vice-President of Research & Development at a quaint company called [IndiQus](https://indiqus.com), where we help set up public, private and hybrid clouds for a variety of enterprises and telecom groups. We also do a lot of cloud architecture consulting and delivery for a lot of companies, and that's where I roll right in.

I'm a major history buff - European and West Asian history really interests me, especially the Ottoman Empire, its dissolution and subsequent developments in West Asia. And i'm a major progressive rock and indie music consumer - artists like The National, alt-J, Porcupine Tree, Steve Wilson, Pineapple Thief, Blackfield, Riverside, Japanese Breakfast, Slowdive, Thievery Corporation, Amber Run, Metric, Pink Floyd, Gregory Alan Isakov and Iron & Wine are what you'd typically find on my Apple Music playlists.
